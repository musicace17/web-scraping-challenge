## IMPORTANT NOTE:
This code has been adjusted for Firefox with Geckodriver instead of Chrome- the 'executable path' line in the notebook should be adjusted to whatever directory you have for Geckodriver.

- Stack Overflow: Dmitri T from [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58053067/how-to-install-geckodriver-in-mac-terminal-permission-operation-not-permitted) gave me the idea to point the Browser to my latest download of Geckodriver.
- ChatGPT: Revised the code idea from Dmitri T to still be used with Splinter instead of Selenium in order to more easily use any code provided in the challenge files without adjusting them.
